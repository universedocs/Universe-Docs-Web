Universe Docs Web

Web site for the Universe Docs application

It is a REST Web Service that serves the web pages. The web pages are nothing but the Universe Docs documents with web view generated (JavaScript) from Universe Docs document view model! The view model will be received by JavaScript client (web browser) and it generates view on the fly! So you can view those documents both in web site and in Universe Docs application! For example privacy and agreements can be seen both in app. and website!

The website should behave like a native application! 

This web service listens in one port and "Universe Docs Brain" listens in another port!

Software requirements:
1. Bootstrap / Whatever PWA latest and best one
2. Swift
3. Kitura
